# üå´Ô∏è Market Fit Research for Air Purifier Development Using AQI Analytics

## üè∑Ô∏è Domain:
**Consumer Appliances | Market Research Analytics**

## üè¢ Company:
**AirPure Innovations** ‚Äî A startup responding to India's air quality crisis.

---

## üìò Project Overview

India is home to **14 of the top 20 most polluted cities in the world**, creating a pressing public health concern. In response, **AirPure Innovations** is exploring the launch of a smart, efficient air purifier. However, before investing in full-scale production and R&D, the company seeks to assess whether the **market demand is strong and sustainable**.

This project performs a **data-driven product-market fit analysis**, leveraging AQI and pollution data to inform business strategy, feature design, and geographic targeting.

---

## üéØ Objective

To evaluate the **market fit** for an air purifier product using:
- Air quality analytics (AQI & pollutants)
- Consumer demand estimation
- Competitor feature benchmarking
- Regional pollution pattern analysis
---

## üåç Real-World Context

> üß™ **Bryan Johnson**, a biotech entrepreneur, recently walked out of a podcast due to high indoor AQI.  
> üè® **Delhi‚Äôs Taj Hotels** now display AQI readings in lobbies.  

These examples reflect rising **consumer awareness** and **market readiness** for air quality solutions.

 ## Observations : 
 1. India‚Äôs Alarming AQI Levels
- In 2024, India‚Äôs average AQI was ~110, nearly 50x higher than WHO's safe limit for PM2.5.
- Cities like Delhi (AQI: 300+), Ghaziabad, Kanpur, and Lucknow frequently experience ‚Äòsevere‚Äô air quality, highlighting an urgent need for indoor air solutions.
2. Dominant Pollutants & Product-Market Fit
- PM2.5 and PM10, from vehicles, construction, and industries, are the top air pollutants.
- HEPA-based air purifiers (plus activated carbon filters) align perfectly to combat these pollutants indoors.
3. Health Crisis Misalignment
- IDSP data reveals respiratory outbreaks (e.g., in Chhattisgarh, Odisha) don‚Äôt always align with AQI hotspots.
- This calls for preventive indoor purification‚Äîbeyond AQI‚Äîespecially in hospitals, offices, and schools.
4. EV Adoption as a Proxy for Awareness
- High EV adoption in Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad reflects growing environmental and health awareness.
- These regions are primed for early adoption of air purification technologies.
5. Target Market Segmentation
- Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Pune, Ahmedabad) offer strong potential due to: High AQI, Higher per capita income (PCI), Higher health product penetration
- Tier-3 cities like Raipur, Patna, Jabalpur, Bhagalpur show low AQI awareness.Invest in education campaigns before sales push.
